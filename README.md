### Fitness App Business Problem

**Concepts:** Relational Database Management, Data Management

**Software & Languages:** SQL, MySQL

**Packages:** N/A

**Description:** This project was conducted as a group for a Data Management and Analytics course I took at UGA. It was actually the first coding class I ever took, so please bare with me. My group was tasked with finding a real technology problem for a company, building a database and queries to help fix part of the issues, and make recommendations on what to do next. We decided to create new hypothetical subscription plans for FitBit: one being a sleep database and tracker, and the second being recommendations generated for a user with the "original" database. I do not have access to the database anymore, but I did include the SQL queries in a file included in the repository. The report displays the business problem, queries and outputs, data dictionaries, and database model.
